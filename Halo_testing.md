In the videos the testers are doing in house testing or white box testing before they ship the game at launch, in the videos the testers are testing every playstyle they can think of when people play the game to determin which weapon or which piece of cover could give the player a huge upper hand over the others to which sooner or later when the game ships the community wont be blasting the company saying  
that the game is trash.

as the video continues, one of the testers says that it takes a long process of like 3 years to fully test a game to make sure it works well and that there are no bugs that will break the game, and in that time period the company hase user tests to where they bring in actual players and study the way players play and how they feel and act playing the game. the tester then talks about how when testing and fixing some bugs they will create new bugs that will throw other thing off their tracks.

One of the people in the video said that the testers whole job is to make sure that the whole gae is stable and that they are the ones who
decide weither the game is stable enough for launch or if not so they can tell the studio head that they need more time to fix the game, however he then talks about how its importaint to let the team know about the changes to the game becasue there could be a risky code change that can fix a few problems but then will also create a bunch more later on in production.
