## Details

### Game Title
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/

### Rating
I rate this game from 1-10, and the rank I would give this game would be a 8

## Summary
This game is a multiplayer base game that doesn't have a pratical story campagin, But focuses heavily on the multiplayer part of the game 
where the player can group up with other playeres choose curtain operators to kill off the other teams operators 
or complete what ever the objective of that game is.  

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like the fact of players being able ping abuse the game becasue i could be hiding and
someone gets a kill on me outta the blue.
