### Rating
I rate the gae from 1-5, I'd give it a 4.5 becasue the game is fun but can get a little stale after a long secesion. 

## Summary
In this game the players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, 
buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, 
with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards,
and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions.  

## Final Thoughts
I like the game becasue it give you the satisfaction of making your friends pay you fake cash, and also being able to taunt them for fun.
