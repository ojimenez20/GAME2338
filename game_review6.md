### Rating
from a rateing of 1 to 5 i give it a 3

## Summary
This game is about the players playing as a shark or human to where the sharks have to kill all the humans and wste all their lives
while the humans have to collect a curtain amount of treasure and get back to the cage to escape that when the other players 
"the sharks" have to kill the player befor they escape.
## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like how the sharks can have starange abilities and upgrades that make them overpowered
becasue some of their abilities appear to be broken in which they cant be killed and sometimes get faster killing sprees.
