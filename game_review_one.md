## Summary
This game is about a nameless character (ashen one) who journeyes in the harsh world that is dark souls that is filled with in relenting and unforgiving mobs, to eventually save the world depending on the ending the players gerts. the whole point of the players journey is to fight the lords of cinder and use their trinkets to travel to the worlds end and snuff out the eternal flame and set the world right. in this game the players can upgrade their character stats such as strength and vigor as well as manyother thing that can grant the players the abilities to be over powered and survive the horrors they will face in dark souls 3.      

## Final Thoughts
i like the character upgrade system becasue in most games the layer is automatically given the upgrade points while in dark souls 3 and dark souls in generally you need to "farm" or grind out killing mobs and bosses to get the points or "souls" to ungrade at the homebase or "firelink shrine".
