Minecraft- i had choosen reliability, and because i chose it was because the game in in my control i can make anything i want in that game.

Smash. Bros.- for this game i choose useability becasue when you play this game and the characters it has, as the player i
had to learn how the character work and what were their ultimates so.

Portal- for this game i used the quaity of reuseability becasue the game can be played in many ways that are unique and the game
