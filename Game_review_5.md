# Game Review for Magic the gatherng

## Details

### Game Title
Magioc the Gathering, https://magic.wizards.com/en

### Rating
 I would rate this game from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 4 star rating.

## Summary
This game is about a battle between wizards known as planeswalkers who cast spells, use artifacts,
and summon creatures as depicted on individual cards in order to defeat their opponents, typically,
but not always, by draining them of their 20 starting life points in the standard format.
Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as 
Dungeons & Dragons, the gameplay bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while simultaneously 
having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games.

## Final Thoughts
I like the game but didn't like the fact that there are so many rules and guidelines to follow of what players can and cannot do.
